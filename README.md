# hello-world
The Ring-Leader only Rests when its over, and its NEVER over.

When you feel as if you are going to give up, fall apart, and let it go, just remember this:
" THE TROUBLES AND PAIN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, IS PREPARING YOU FOR WHAT YOU ASKED FOR "
            -Trey
 
 Dont give up just yet. Hold on just a little longer because tomorrow may be the day everything turns around for you.
